# superstore-analytics-mustaqim-mohabbat
Summary
This project explores sales data from a Superstore using Python in Google Colab and Excel. We analyzed performance across regions, categories, and top products using KPIs and visualizations.

Key Insights
1. The West region had the highest sales and profit, indicating strong performance and customer engagement.
2. Canon products were top sellers, likely due to frequent business use and demand for office supplies.

Excel vs. Python Reflection
Excel was great for creating quick PivotTables and simple charts as always. However, Python seemed easier to me and offered more flexibility and deeper insights, especially for calculating custom KPIs like delivery time. Python also made it easier to automate repetitive tasks and create more polished visuals and overall i like the UI better too and i honestly found it simpler than excel with the help of Gemini.
